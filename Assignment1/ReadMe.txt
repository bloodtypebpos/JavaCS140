This is the beginning of the Assignment. So far, I have created the class for the employee to include the Employee's name, ID number, pay and hours worked. There is a prompt to enter the fields before entering in the Employee's information. I have also included get/set methods.
============================UPDATES============================================
First example is complete. Every feature is completed. Next step is to include all the other pages to be attached. I'll link them when I'm finished.



I will be editing this ReadMe with updates at the top. Immediately underneath will be the links to the other required part to the assignment.
